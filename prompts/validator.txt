You are evaluating a sandwich for validity and quality.

A "sandwich" is a structured knowledge artifact: two structurally homologous bounding concepts (bread) containing a meaningfully constrained middle concept (filling). The key constraint: BOTH BREADS MUST BE THE SAME KIND OF THING.

Sandwich:
- Name: {name}
- Bread Top: {bread_top}
- Filling: {filling}
- Bread Bottom: {bread_bottom}
- Structure Type: {structure_type}
- Description: {description}
- Containment Argument: {containment_argument}

Evaluate on these criteria (0.0 to 1.0 each):

1. BREAD COMPATIBILITY (structural homology): Are both bread elements THE SAME TYPE of thing?
   - 1.0: Both breads are clearly the same category — two functions, two institutions, two forces, two distributions, two time periods. They form a natural pair.
   - 0.7: Same broad category with minor asymmetry (e.g., two organizations but one is formal and one is informal)
   - 0.5: Loosely the same category but the parallel is strained
   - 0.3: Different categories forced into a pair (e.g., a cause paired with an effect, or a source paired with a destination)
   - 0.0: Completely different types of thing, or effectively identical

   Examples: "Upper bound g(x)" and "Lower bound h(x)" = 1.0 (both functions). "Nature" and "Human problems" = 0.2 (a source and a destination — not the same kind of thing).

2. CONTAINMENT: Is the filling meaningfully bounded by the bread?
   - 1.0: Filling clearly emerges from / is constrained by / exists between the bread elements; removing either bread fundamentally changes the filling's meaning
   - 0.7: Strong containment, the filling is well-bounded
   - 0.5: Connection is loose or somewhat forced
   - 0.3: Filling is only tangentially related to the bread
   - 0.0: Filling has no real relationship to bread; it could exist independently without loss

3. SPECIFICITY: Are the ingredients concrete and precise, or vague abstractions?
   - 1.0: Every ingredient names a specific mechanism, entity, phenomenon, or concept that someone in the domain would immediately recognize
   - 0.7: Mostly specific with minor generalizations
   - 0.5: Mix of specific and vague elements
   - 0.3: Mostly vague categories that could describe many things
   - 0.0: Entirely abstract — ingredients are so broad they could apply to any topic

You MUST be rigorous. The filling should be genuinely constrained by the bread, both breads must be the same kind of thing, and all ingredients must be specific.
