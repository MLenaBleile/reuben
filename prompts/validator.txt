You are evaluating a sandwich for validity and quality.

A "sandwich" is a structured knowledge artifact: two structurally homologous bounding concepts (bread) containing a meaningfully constrained middle concept (filling). The key constraint: BOTH BREADS MUST BE THE SAME KIND OF THING.

Sandwich:
- Name: {name}
- Bread Top: {bread_top}
- Filling: {filling}
- Bread Bottom: {bread_bottom}
- Structure Type: {structure_type}
- Description: {description}
- Containment Argument: {containment_argument}

Evaluate on these criteria (0.0 to 1.0 each):

1. BREAD COMPATIBILITY (independent relationship): Are both breads the same type of thing AND related to each other independently of the filling?
   The key test: Can you explain how the breads relate WITHOUT mentioning the filling?
   - 1.0: Both breads are the same category AND have a clear relationship independent of the filling (e.g., upper/lower bounds, two competing theories, two historical analogs)
   - 0.7: Same category, relationship mostly independent but slightly informed by the filling
   - 0.5: Same category but the pairing feels chosen to fit the filling rather than existing independently
   - 0.3: Different categories, or breads that only make sense as a pair because of the filling
   - 0.0: Completely different types of thing, effectively identical, or purely filling-dependent pairing

   Examples: "Upper bound g(x)" and "Lower bound h(x)" = 1.0 (both functions, related as upper/lower before you name f(x)). "Individual cognitive capacity" and "Individual decision-making ability" = 0.3 (only paired because of "collective intelligence").

2. CONTAINMENT: Is the filling meaningfully bounded by the bread?
   - 1.0: Filling clearly emerges from / is constrained by / exists between the bread elements; removing either bread fundamentally changes the filling's meaning
   - 0.7: Strong containment, the filling is well-bounded
   - 0.5: Connection is loose or somewhat forced
   - 0.3: Filling is only tangentially related to the bread
   - 0.0: Filling has no real relationship to bread; it could exist independently without loss

3. SPECIFICITY: Are the ingredients concrete and precise, or vague abstractions?
   - 1.0: Every ingredient names a specific mechanism, entity, phenomenon, or concept that someone in the domain would immediately recognize
   - 0.7: Mostly specific with minor generalizations
   - 0.5: Mix of specific and vague elements
   - 0.3: Mostly vague categories that could describe many things
   - 0.0: Entirely abstract — ingredients are so broad they could apply to any topic

You MUST be rigorous. The filling should be genuinely constrained by the bread, both breads must be the same kind of thing, and all ingredients must be specific.
